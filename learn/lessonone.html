<h1>Shmorsh</h1>
<h2>Lesson One: Important rules</h2>
<p>There are three steps to making a word:</p>
<p>1. Get the root word.</p>
<p>2. Find the part of speech, gender, and subtype of the word.</p>
<p>3. Find the correct ending for the word based on these three things.</p>
<p>Example: the sentence 'I walk'.</p>
<p>1. Find the roots. (I=mi, and walk=waki)</p>
<p>2. Find the POS, gender, and subtype. (mi=pronoun, and it does not have specific gender or subtype that is necessary. Waki=verb, and it needs to have the neutral gender ending for the subtype 'Present Nominative Singular'.</p>
<p>3. Find the word's endings (mi is a pronoun that does not need endings, and waki needs the ending -otona for Present Nominative Singular.)</p>
<p>Our completed sentence: mi wakiotona.</p>
<p>Other rules:</p>
<p>Shmorsh has the english alphabet but there are NO SILENT LETTERS!</p>
<p>Shmorsh language order is the same as english.</p>
<p>Though Shmorsh may seem like a worse version of English, it is also based on Latin! (As you can tell because of all the word endings we added - you will see in future lessons!)</p>
