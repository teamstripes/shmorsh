<h1>Shmorsh</h1>
<p>The international language of stupid and sophistication.</p>
<p>Made by sussiemaster and ThePTNT</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Lesson One: Important rules</h2>
<p>There are three steps to making a word:
1. Get the root word.
2. Find the part of speech, gender, and subtype of the word.
3. Find the correct ending for the word based on these three things.</p>
<p>Example: the sentence 'I walk'.
1. Find the roots. (I=Miselp, and walk=waki)
2. Find the POS, gender, and subtype. (Miselp=pronoun, and it does not have specific gender or subtype that is necessary. Waki=verb, and it needs to have the neutral gender ending for the subtype 'Present Nominative Singular'.
3. Find the word's endings (Miselp is a pronoun that does not need endings, and Waki needs the ending -otona for Present Nominative Singular.)
Our completed sentence: Miselp wakiotona.
Other rules:
Shmorsh has the english alphabet but there are NO SILENT LETTERS!
Shmorsh language order is the same as english.
Though Shmorsh may seem like a worse version of English, it is also based on Latin! (As you can tell because of all the word endings we added.)</p>
